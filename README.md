# Directed & Weighted Graphs - EX3_OOP

This project is based on a previous assigment of ***Directed and Weighted Graphs*** but for this one we need to implement on *Python*. This exercise is composed of two main parts, the first is to implement the two main interfaces GraphInterface and GraphAlgoInterface in order to create all the elements that form a graph. The second part is the GUI, which will allow us to really visualize the graph and all its parameters and options.

- Website of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to learn about all the components and function to create a GUI in Pyhton.

## Interfaces & Classes ðŸŽ¯

There are 5 classes defined in this project, the interfaces are in the ```api``` package and their implementations can be found in ```classes``` package. Their properties and 
methods are detailed below.

### <ins>***1 - Node***<ins> 

This class is a simple representation of a vertex on a directed weighted graph and implement a set of different operations.

Each ```Node``` contains five attributes:

  - ```key```: This is the ID associated to each node.
  - ```location```: This is the position of the node in a 3D dimension with 3 coordinates(x,y,z).
  - ```tag```: This is an Integer value used to calculate several algorithms initialized to 0.
  - ```info```: This is a string corresponding to nodeâ€™s meta data which helps us to calculate various functions initialized to "White".
  - ```_in```: This is a dictionary that contains all the edges incoming to this node.
  
  <br />
  
  | **Functions**      |    **Explanation**        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `_init__(self, location=Geolocation(), key=0)` | Initialize a new Node set 0 as default key |

### <ins>***2 - Edge***<ins>
  
 This class designes all the characteristics and operations applicable on a directional edge defined by its source and destination in a directional weighted graph.

  An ```Edge``` is discribed by five fields:
  
  - ```src```: This integer represents the source node of the edge.
  - ```dest```: This integer represents the destination node of the edge.
  - ```weight```: This is a double variable used as edge's weight, must be positive. 
  
<br />
  
  | **Functions**      |    **Explanation**        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `__init__(self, source=0, destination=0, weight=0.0)` | Initialize a new Edge set its parameters to 0 as default value |
| `get_source(self) -> int` | Returns the id of the source node of this edge |
| `set_source(self, new_source) -> None` | Change the source of the edge as *new_source* |
| `get_destination(self) -> int` | Return the destination of the edge |
| `set_destination(self, new_destination) -> None` | Change the destination of the edge as *new_destination* |
| `get_weight(self) -> float` | Return the weight of the edge |
| `set_weight(self, new_weight) -> None` | Change the weight of the edge as *new_weight* |

  ### <ins>***3 - GeoLocation***<ins>
  
 This class contains all the elements needed for a point 3D visualization in a directed weighted graph.
  
 Only three coordonates constitute a ```GeoLocation``` in a 3D space:
  
  - ```x```: the nodeâ€™s value on the x axis.
  - ```y```: the nodeâ€™s value on the y axis.
  - ```z```: the nodeâ€™s value on the z axis.

    <br />

| **Methods**      |    **Explanation**        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `__init__(self, x=0, y=0, z=0)` |  Initialize a new Geolocation set its parameters to 0 as default value |
| `distance(self, loc) -> float` | Returns the distance location between two nodes |
| `x()` | Returns the x axis value |
| `y()` | Returns the y axis value |
| `z()` | Returns the z axis value |

  <br />
  
  ### <ins>***4 - DiGraph***<ins>
  
  
  DiGraph implemented by GraphInterface, this class gathers all the necessary components and features in order to build a Directed and Weighted Graph.
  
  The essential elements for the configuration of the ```DiGraph``` are:
  
  - ```number_of_node```: This Integer represents the amount of nodes in the graph.
  - ```number_of_edges```: This Integer represents the amount of edges in the graph.
  - ```mc```: This Integer is a counter that increments by one for any change in the graph. 
  - ```nodes```:  This a dictionary containing all the nodes in the graph.
  - ```edges```: This a dictionary containing all the edges in the graph..

   ### <ins>***5 - DiGraphAlgo***<ins>
  
  Implemented by GraphAlgoInterface, DiGraphAlgo is the most important class that does the most "hardest job". Indeed, it will use certain algorithms and import external libraries which will allow us to perform several actions on the DiGraph.
  
  `DiGraphAlgo` is characterized by only one object: a `DiGraph`.
